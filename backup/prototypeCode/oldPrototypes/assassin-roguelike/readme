Controls: WASD for movement, E to attack enemies
Phantoms move randomly until you fall into their line of sight, then they will attack.
If you die, press SPACE to respawn and your corpse will come back to life as a phantom. If you die too many times, you will essentially be swarmed with enemies.
You lose once the number of phantoms reaches 10.
You win once you kill all the phantoms.
