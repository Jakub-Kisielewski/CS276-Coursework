# Notes
## MDA Framework
* Mechanics - rules and systems that make up a game
* Dynamics - emergetn behaviour from mechanics (not programmed)
* Aesthetic - emotional responses and experiences that game evokes in player a.k.a "How should player feel?"

Approach MDA framework as both a designer and a player.
