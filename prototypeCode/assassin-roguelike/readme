Controls: WASD for movement, E to attack enemies
Enemies move randomly until you fall into their line of sight, then they will attack.
If you die, press SPACE to respawn and your corpse will come back to life as an enemy. If you die too many times, you will essentially be swarmed with enemies.
Currently the game isn't challenging so just let yourself die a few times to make it more enjoyable.
