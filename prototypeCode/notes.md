# Notes
---
* Prototype should just be implementation of core game. No graphics and no extra features. 
* Define what core loop should be before starting prototype

## Core loop definition
* Situation -> Action/Response -> Reward/Outcome
* Situation - what scenario does player start in e.g in pacman there is maze with ghosts and pellets
* Situation can evolve during game loop
* Action/Response - how should player respond to situation
* Outcome/Reward - what is result of player responding to sitation. Positive or negative outcome based on how player responded
* Should show player what it means to be successful before game loop starts (more for game than prototype)
